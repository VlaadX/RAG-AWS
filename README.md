# RAG-AWS
A system using AWS Bedrock and AWS Polly creates a "smart assistant" that answers questions based on your private documents and speaks the answers aloud. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find relevant information in your files before generating a response, ensuring the answers are accurate and context-specific.
